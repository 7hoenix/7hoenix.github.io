title: Goals that work
---

In 2012, I finally took the time to write down all of my goals.

Long story short, I got 95% of everything that I wrote down.

The biggest thing on my list back then was that I weighed close to 260 pounds. .
. and I knew that that was high.

At the very top of the page I wrote:

“I want to weigh 185 pounds.”

This affirmation worked because it was constantly at the top of my mind and I
had a great strategy to get it. . . but it wasn’t nearly as good as it could
have been as I was missing out on a lot of the elements for effective goal
setting.

Your Subconscious Syntax

Syntax: In programming, syntax is the exact combination of keystrokes you have
to use in order to communicate with your computer and get it to do something for
you.

Like in html (the language of websites) to bold a word in a sentence the syntax
you need is:

<b>word</b>

If you screw up any aspect of the syntax then your word won’t be bolded. Its
that simple.

With goal setting you are pretty much writing a computer program (which is like
a set of instructions that a computer executes).

If you write down the wrong instructions then the computer will give you
something wrong on the output side.

Your brain works the same way. If you give it the wrong instructions/syntax then
it wont know what to do with the instructions you are trying to give it. . . and
NOTHING will happen (in fact in some cases you will actually be worse off).

How to talk with your subconscious

So what specifically is the syntax you need to use when talking with your brain?

ITS really easy. So don’t overthink it. Just remember APPS (like the food).

ACHIEVABLE: Your brain has a built in BS detector

In our example above if you weigh 260 pounds, 185 pounds will strike your brain
as a bold faced lie. Your subconscious will think that you are “just talking”
because 185 pounds is such a big shift from 260.

In other words your subconscious has a built in BS detector that will be going
off like crazy.

Unfortunately, your BS detector won’t alert you that it’s going off. . . instead
it just wont allow you to get to your goal.

If you make $37,000 and put down that you want to make $1,000,000. . . it won’t
work (sorry). Try $50,000 or $65,000 and once you get that try $100,000 or
$122,000.

|POSITIVE|: Your subconscious works like |absolute value| from math class

This one is scary.

If your conscious mind declares “I’m NOT a smoker”. . . your subconscious is
going to drop the negative and return => “I’m a smoker”.

You read that right.

Orrrrrrrrr. . .

“I’m not fat” => “I’m fat.”

“I’m not poor” => “I’m poor.”

“I don’t like Y” => “I like Y.”

If you state your goals with a negative then you will actually get the exact
opposite of what you are intending.

Therefore, the biggest thing is to keep things in the positive tense. That way,
at least you aren’t moving backwards.

The biggest thing is to keep things positive.

PRESENT: State your goals as if you already had them

Your subconscious hears “I’m going to” lose weight this year and its like a
short circuit. You have just gotten rid of 80% + of the value of your
affirmation.

NOTE: (80% is an estimate. . . any conscious effort to make a change will have a
net positive effect. Its just not optimal.)

Instead you need to keep things in the present tense (even if they aren’t true
yet)!

Lets keep it going with our previous example:

I am ripped. I weigh 200 pounds.

I am (positive and present tense) ripped. I weigh (positive/present) 200pounds
(to get past your BS detector).

Perfect now you know the basics.

SPECIFIC: Now let’s overdrive it

You could stop at the above and get most of the benefit. Your brain will find a
way to make your new reality become true for you.

But to turn it up the heat and guarantee our results come up with a few specific
examples to really drive home the point that you want your brain to get for you.

I do CrossFit 3X per week.
I can do every CrossFit movement with ease.
I know every nuance of paleo.
