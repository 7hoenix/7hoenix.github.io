title: 25 Xer through flow
---

My friend Sebastian Abondano had this awesome quote on his blog post (great blog
post about mastery and how to get there) from Steve Jobs:

“In most businesses, the difference between average and good is at best 2 to 1,
right? Like, if you go to New York and you get the best cab driver in the city,
you might get there 30% faster than with an average taxicab driver. A 2 to 1
gain would be pretty big.

The difference between the best worker on computer hard-ware and the average may
be 2 to 1, if you’re lucky. With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1. But in software,
it’s at least 25 to 1. The difference between the average programmer and a great
one is at least that.

The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the
best people in the world. And when you’re in a field where the dynamic range is
25 to 1, boy, does it pay off.”

Sounds awesome. I’m sold. But how does one go about becoming a 25X’er? It sounds
like Job’s believes in the “prodigy myth” which isn’t really helpful if you are
trying to hack hyper-productivity.

Enter Flow

Flow is a growing body of research around recent massive breakthroughs in what
was previously thought impossible.

The biggest areas where we started noticing flow were in extreme sports (in many
sports we are seeing consistent 200-300% gains in performance year over year…).

Skateboarding
Bungie Jumping
Surfing
etc.
Many CEO’s claim that they have experienced up to 500% boosts of productivity
whenever they are operating with flow.

 

 How Flow works

 Power of Habit (Charles Duhigg) brings up some research where rats would travel
 down a maze looking for a piece of cheese. At first it would take a ton of
 mental effort to find the cheese. But over time the rat wouldn’t have to think
 anymore about finding the cheese. The rat had earned a certain sense of
 “mastery” (for that maze anyways) and could now perform the task without having
 to expend any thoughts on how to find the cheese.

 By practicing your surroundings you can decrease the amount of brain power that
 you need to accomplish a task (freeing you up to think about something higher
 level or planning your next move).

 Example

 Whenever I first started this journey I wanted to make mobile apps because I
 figured that all the money was in mobile apps. It seemed like a good idea but
 the difficulty was I was programming on a mac laptop that I bought used for
 like $800.

 If I changed the color of a button. . . I would have to wait 12 seconds (literally.)
 until I could see the change I’d made on the screen. Keeping a sense of “what”
 I was trying to do (and much more importantly “why”) was damn near impossible.
 The screen would start loading and I would start thinking about coffee… video
 games… or food. It wasn’t until I upgraded my computer and realized that with a
 decent computer it took less than a second to load the exact same thing how big
 of a difference it made.

 Now its much easier for me to maintain my flow (because I change something and
 can get almost immediate feedback on what I just changed).

 Since I’ve noticed how big of a difference a good work flow makes I’ve been
 practicing ways of optimizing my flow going forwards.

 Flow is the act of high speed problem solving where your mind reaches a well
 met task (just a little too hard for you) and you drop into a different state
 of mind.

 Recently I’ve been spending a ton of time thinking about how to optimize my own
 personal work flow (movement around my workstation with minimal effort).

 Enter Vim.

 The first time you see someone using Vim it literally looks like the person
 using it is a magician moving around the computer. It’s a totally different way
 of getting around the computer from anything you’ve ever seen before and its
 mind blowing.

 In my mind an experienced Vim user is in a much much much better place to
 maintain flow than the average programmer running around with Atom or Sublime
 Text.

 How can you put a price on flow?

 You can’t. What does 500% productivity mean? It means you are in a totally
 different head space than you would have been otherwise.

 It’s not just Vim though. I’m also working my way through a document on bash.
 Even how to google better.

 Any of these gains will work multiplicatively with my other efforts as they
 will hopefully lead to more flow.

 Do the reaches on the hard skills so that you just have them so that you can
 focus on the soft skills.
