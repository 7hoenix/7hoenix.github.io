title: Chess player goals
---

Your brain is like a giant search engine for goals. You can read more about that
here. Until you narrow your goal down and tell your brain exactly what it’s
looking for, it simply won’t work. Or at least it won’t work well.

The very first step before everything else is to decide on a series of win
conditions for your brain.

Win Conditions = ways that the game will end.

 

 Without setting specific win conditions in your mind, you’re essentially
 playing chess with no rules for ending the game, and you will simply move the
 pieces haphazardly.

 What other option does your brain have? It makes no difference if you move your
 pieces one way or the other.  You will play indefinitely and never end the
 game.

 Moves won’t be logical and you will not be taking advantage of your reticular
 activating system. This is the system for identifying problems from backwards
 in. A friend of mine describes the system a little bit differently on his blog
 here.

 When you take advantage of this system your brain is moving around quickly
 looking for ways to get from y to x.

 That’s why it’s so important to begin with the end in mind.

 Tim Ferriss in his book 4 Hour Chef (amazing book by the way…) tells the story
 of Bobby Fischer.

 Bobby Fischer (one of the best chess players of all time) => Learned how to
 play Chess backwards.

 Most players, as they first begin to play chess will follow the below approach:

 Learn how to set up the board – After all, if you can’t set up the board, then
 how will you ever learn to play?
 Learn how the pieces move – Again, If you don’t know how the pieces move, how
 will you play the game?
 Learn how to win (Point Z) – Get the enemy king into checkmate.
  

  Got all that?

  Great. Let’s play.

  You will spend the next several hundred games learning how to get from point A
  to point Z.

  What did Bobby Fischer do that was different? Could it be a clue as to his
  great success?

  Bobby Fischer’s instructor did the exact opposite.

  The instructor sat Bobby down and he arranged the board as just King v. King
  and pawn.

   

   Once Bobby understood how to go from King v. King and Pawn then the
   instructor would add a piece.

   Slowly they worked their way backwards to a full board.

   Maybe you are thinking that the instructor was “dumbing it down” so that the
   young Bobby would be able to understand it better. Perhaps he was.

   However, something very dramatic was happening here.

  

  Bobby was internalizing win conditions right from the get go.

   

  What if all you needed was one extra pawn going into end game and you knew
  you could win?

  Would that make you a more confident chess player?

  Here’s how it plays out mathematically:

  In Chess, theres a point ranking system assigned to your pieces so that you
  can quickly figure out who’s winning (obviously not taking into
  consideration the more deep strategic things like position, pawn structure,
  etc.).

  Its pretty straight forward:

  Queen => 9 points

  Rook => 5 points

  Bishop and Knight => 3 points

  Pawn => 1 point

  At the beginning of the game each player has 39 points ((9 * 1 Queen) + (5
  * 2 Rooks) + (3 * 4 Bishops and Knights) + (1 * 8 Pawns)).
  
  To assess the relative strength of each player you could simply arrange
  these two numbers as a ratio => (39 points for white / 39 points for
  black) at the beginning is exactly even at 100%.
  
  If you are up a pawn at the beginning its not a huge deal. In fact,
  relative point value is approximately negligible.
  
  38 / 39 => 97.4%
  
  What happens with this single point advantage towards the end of the game
  as attrition reduces the total pieces on the board?
  
  9 / 10 => 90%
  
  4 / 5 => 80%
  
  1 / 2 => 50%
  
  0 / 1 => 0%
  
  It is this imbalance that was ingrained directly into Bobby’s mind.
  
  The meta game, or game within the game, that is being played. The primary
  tactic behind everything else.
  
  Bobby wasn’t just learning mating patterns (win conditions). He was also
  learning the best way to get there.
  
  
  
  The first step is to understand where you are trying to go.
  
  Have a core understanding of what that looks like and, in essence,
  that’s what we are going to do as well.
  
  We start with your win condition – What does it look like and why are
  you going to pour so much time and effort into it?
