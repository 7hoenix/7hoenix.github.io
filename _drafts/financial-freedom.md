title: Financial Freedom
---

Most of this is applied knowledge from Tony Robbins (the man is a genius with a
huge heart).

Anyways.

The first thing you need to do is get a handle on how much money you need to
have before you have “gotten there”.

Your brain is like a giant search engine for goals

If you put in what you want then your brain will go about trying to make that a
reality.

By understanding exactly how much money you need to have and by when your brain
is now motivated to make that thing become a reality .

Robbins brings you through 5 different levels (financial security, financial
vitality, financial independence, financial freedom, and absolute financial
freedom).

I’m not going to go into his system too too deep because I truly think you
should buy his book and read every word. Or go on Audible and listen to it as I
did 😉

5 different levels of financial freedom

S = Financial Security
Having enough to cover your 5 basic expenses without you having to work
V = Financial Vitality
S + half of your other expenses
I = Financial Independence
V + the other half of your expenses
F = Financial Freedom
Living at a level you would actually enjoy living at without ever having to work
again
A = Absolute Financial Freedom
Being able to live the lifestyle that you can only dream about today because it
feels so far off (have you ever wanted a private island or a jet?)
The first thing that I found fascinating was he asks his audience at his live
events: How much do you need for absolute Financial Freedom? Like the islands
and stuff. Well invariably someone in the audience will say that they need like
$1 Billion dollars in order to be able to do exactly as she wants for the rest
of her life.

At his event Robbins then redefines that persons world view by showing them that
they can have the lifestyle for substantially less than the actual cost of
something.

Private Jet example:

If you plan on flying in a private jet maybe 10 times a year. . . then owning
one isn’t really practical and you could have the benefit from renting one for
like 1/1,000 of the cost.

Same thing with an island. You could rent one and bring everyone you wanted too
to the island for a few hundred grand (compared to the tens of millions for
buying it).

So leave your assumptions at the door!

Without further ado here are my actual numbers

If you would prefer to see this in a spreadsheet form go to my website and I
will email you the spreadsheet so you can work it out as well. Just go here:

Stability (S):

Mortgage => $1,100
utility => $400
food => $400
transportation => $700
insurance => $300

= $2,900 total * 12 months => $34,800

Vitality (V): $2,900 (monthly from S) +
1/2 Clothing => $50
1/2 Dining => $350
1/2 luxary costs => $350
= $3,650

Independence (I): $3,650 +
($50 + $350 + $350)
= $5,150

Financial Freedom (F): $5,150 +
Downtown Loft in Denver (million dollar loft baby) => $6,000
Aston Martin DB9 => $2,500
Donations => $8,250
= $21,900

Absolute Financial Freedom (A): $21,900 +
Private island: $62,500
Private Jet: $20,833
Crazy Saturdays (Once a month I get to go out and blow $10 g’s like a
billionaire idiot): $10,000
Places in 7 Countries and 3 States: $50,000
= $165,233

Now convert these numbers to annual by multiplying by 12

S => $34,800
V => $43,800
I => $61,800
F => $262,800
A => $1,982,800

Remember what we just calculated is cash flows for living at different levels
completely free and clear in your own mind.

In order to be able to pull this much out of a plan you need to have roughly 20X
that much invested in a portfolio that is performing at 6% (I can talk about
that later or you can read his book).

So for stability S => $34,800 * 20 = I need approximately $696,000 in my
portfolio
V => $43,800 * 20 = $876,000
I => $61,800 * 20 = $1,236,000
F => $262,800 * 20 = $5,256,000
A => $1,982,800 * 20 = $39,656,000

Pick 3 gateways as your personal road map

Next he says to pick 3 of the 5 goals above to use as benchmarks (and
celebration gateways you can walk through on your own personal journey).

This was easy for me as the first two sounded weak and boring. I’m still in my
20’s so I have time to really let compounding work for me and I’ve never
considered myself average.

So Independence, Freedom and Absolute financial freedom are my gateways.

I am aiming to make it through my first gateway (Financial Independence) by the
time I turn 35.

What bout you?
