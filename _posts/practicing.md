## The art of practicing.

Very few things in this world in terms of mastery acquisition are as important as practicing.

Practicing is the act of going through and putting attention on a problem until it moves from the
difficult to the easy. You are in essence collecting a series of neurons that work together to accomplish
a task and making them work together. It doesn't take long often times at least not as long as you are probably thinking.

Even as few as 10 repetitions can have a pretty noticeable impact.

The biggest thing that most people don't do is bring things from the basic where they have to put
constant attention on something to go through the 3 basic processes.

Katrina Owen came in and talked at Turing school one time.

She was talking about how how High Expertise correlates to cognitive processing management.

She was describing three buckets of expertise.

A: Can't do. If you've ever looked at a regex (without knowing what regex do)... then that is this
bucket. Its so difficult for you to accomplish it that you really just cant do it.

B: Can do. With effort. Tasks like these are within your wheel house but it takes a considerable amount
of effort.
MOST PEOPLE PILE UP HERE.

C: Mastered reliable / automatic. This is the dream. And enables constant and consistent flow.

The way to get there is through consistent practice.

## Cool... but how do you go from B to C?

Katrina also mentioned that the perfect size of a subskill that you should be working towards is < 3 sessions
of 45 - 90 minutes each. If you work on things in those blocks and can practice and acquire the skill in that amount of time
then you are well on your way.

I do my first two pomodoros of the day working on skills like this (although I'll admit that I haven't been as forceful with my
timing as I need to be).

So far I'm working on:

Learn VimScript the Hard way (40% of the way through it)
Which led me to Learn Regex the hard way.

After I get decent at Regex I will go back and finish VimScript
Then I will move on to GitHub or Tmux or something Vim related.

Or Katas (to practice a better work flow).
