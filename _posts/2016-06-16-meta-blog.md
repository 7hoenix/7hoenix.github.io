title: Meta blog => Make this blog in less than an hour with Jekyll. Fo free.
author: Jphoenx

* You need:
  * Github account
  * Ruby
  * RubyGems
  * Mac OS X
  * NodeJS

First things first. How do you go about making a blog.

<h2>
Well at a high level the most important things are 3 fold:
</h2>

1. **Consistency**
(choose a schedule and stick to it). Hate schedules? Yeah... I'm in a similar boat.
So instead you can opt for house of cards style. Just post a batch whenever you feel like it and then
alert your audience via the ones that have opted in. And also self promote over social media.
2. **Pick a topic(s) that you want to focus on.**
Who's your audience? Many people think that they don't
want to pigeon hole themselves into a smaller category (I CAN JUST APPEAL TO EVERYONE)... but this
actually has an inverse effect. By trying to appeal to everyone you end up appealing to no one.
Polarizing is what you are going for. And in order to polarize that means that you need to make some
decisions about what you want to blog about.
3. Actually **get setup** with the technical side.
I'm going to use Jekyll as its free and super easy.

I'm going to go through all three of these steps here... but if you already have done the first two (SERIOUSLY) then feel free to jump
to the HOW TO section all the way at the bottom.

<h2>
Step 1 => Pick a schedule.
</h2>
I'm going to opt for the House of Cards style approach as I don't like being forced into a habit
structure I haven't chosen to adopt. I will remain flexible here though and if I find myself not working
hard enough I may have to change to a differen schedule.

Check.

<h2>
Step 2 => Pick a topic(s) to focus on.
</h2>

* Mastery Acquisition (my biggest passion).
* Code quality, patterns, principles
* Workflow.
* Escaping the 9 - 5 (I think I've done it although I am still working a 9 - 5).
=> I'll leave this open... but I think that this is a great place to start.

Check.

<h2>
Step 3 => Build the thing (the rest of this post is dedicated to that).
</h2>

NOTE: I'm also going to walk you through the specific workflow things that I do (including keystrokes).

<h3>
Go to Chrome (or a different browser if you are a pleb).
</h3>

If Chrome is open I would `command - tab` over and then hit `command - t` to open a new tab where I can search.

If Chrome is not open => I use a plugin called [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and have it bound to `option - spacebar`.

So from anywhere I would hit `option - spacebar` then start typing chrome => `ch` and then `enter`.

Since Chrome pops you right into the search bar I can now type [`jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/). It should be the first link.

<h3>
Go to Jekyll homepage
</h3>

Looks like they have pretty decent documentation... so I'm going to follow that and put any gotchas here in this post.

`$ gem install jekyll`

NOTE: The dollar sign means you are typing this in your terminal... don't actually type it. I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/).


![First Error]({{ site.url }}/thing.jpg)

(WIP blog-jekyll-1) => boom... first error message. Was not expecting it to happen so soon.

My initial thought => I'm doing this on my work computer and I haven't set up Ruby on it yet... so maybe thats the issue.
Also... I know that Ruby is up to version like 2.3.X or something like that... so that could also have something to do with it.

Back to chrome we go.

I typed => `you don't have wri` and the rest of the error message populated itself...
so I held `caps lock - f` to populate the search.(NOTE... caps lock is bound to ctrl).

Also... I use a chrome extension called *Vimium* (WIP) https://vimium.github.io/ so that I can surf the internet without touching my mouse. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.


OK... so I guess my initial thought was correct after reading a stack overflow. I guess that OS X ships with Ruby 2.0.0... but
that's just basic Ruby and not anything that I've done.

I'm going to install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) to get Ruby (RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager).

I'm going to follow their script as I trust RVM as a source.

`$ \curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvm/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer | bash -s stable`

I then had to update my current shell window (you also could close down your terminal and reopen it).

`$ source /Users/jphoenix/.rvm/scripts/rvm`

As of now the latest version of Ruby is 2.3.1 so I'm going to install that.

`$ rvm install 2.3.1`

Note: Ruby takes a while if you have to install it.

OK its finally done.

I ran a quick `$ ruby -v` => "ruby version" to make sure that in worked.

ROUND 2: `$ gem install jekyll`

It worked this time.

OK... it looks like we are pretty much up and running in terms of basic setup... kudos Jekyll.


Continuing on with the documentation:
<h1>
Basic Jekyll usage
</h1>

I read through the Basic Usage section (found a few things I'm interested in but nothing actionable yet).

I tried to read the configuration section until my eyes started glazing over... it seems more like reference
material so I skipped it and moved on.

I read through a lot of the documentation (skipping sections that seemed irrerelant or boring).

The biggest thing when browsing documentation is you want to show your mind that this new thing... is just a thing with some new rules.
And you CAN figure it out.
Also... keep moving. If it doesn't seem relevant or interesting then skip it and come back to it later. Just get a feel for it.


How Jekyll works (accoring to me):

We have 3 different types of things.

* Posts
* Drafts
* Pages

We can style any of these using something called *Front Matter* where we can specify stuff like:

* Layout
* Author

I plan on making a layout default for posts and pages, etc.

Posts need to have a format that begins with a date (the date posted). And drafts are just posts that don't have a date yet.

In order to get a page to display you do the following:

blog_directory/about/index.html
blog_directory/contact/index.html
This will generate routes => jphoenx.com/about && jphoenx.com/contact

Then I can adjust a default layout for pages (which both of those are pages). And I'm off to the races.

I can reference all posts (like my homepage displaying all the recent posts for instance)
using the following syntax (reminds me of ERB):

(WIP blog-jekyll-5)

the `site` command is given to us.
As well as `page`

It can also support collections if you specify them (I'll probably use `skills` at first).

IT SUPPORTS SASS. That is super cool.

Do 2 things to get it setup:

1) blog_directory/css/main.scss
Triple dashes x2
/---
/---
@import
	"base",
	"layout"
;

2) blog_directory/\_sass/\_base.scss

----------------------------------------------------------

JUST DO IT.

Ok... so now that I'm feeling comfortable with how Jekyll is working I feel ready to build the blog.

So now its time to pick a theme (unless you are an ace designer... which I am not).

A quick search for `jekyll themes` pulled up a ton of options.

The very first one looks pretty good. So lets do that => [mono theme](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono)

I went to that github page and clicked the *clone or download* button and then copied the link.

NOTE => I have SSH set up... so if you don't then you will have to do something slightly different here.

`$ git clone git@github.com:AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono.git jphoenx.github.io`
=> USE YOUR OWN USERNAME INSTEAD OF jphoenx

(WIP blog-jekyll-2)

NICE! That was very easy.

Now to actually start making changes to it... I don't think purple is really my color.

`$ jekyll serve` => this command will make a new server that you can get to from your browser at localhost:4000

Error... missing some gems.

`$ gem install jekyll-sitemap jekyll-feed`

Then run serve again.

Now we can look at our changes without pushing them up to github.


Open up your file structure in your text editor of choice.

I use vim (and I have vim aliased to v)

So from within the project directory I would just type `$ v .` to look at everything at once.

First place I went to was to change out that purple background color to blue. Since we are using SASS it was
really easy. I just went to \_sass/\_variables.scss and changed the $mono-color variable.


Next stop was inside of \_config.yml

I changed my name and description and I changed the email and github to be my own.

NOTE => if you change \_config.yml then you need to `ctrl - c` your server and restart it.

Trade out the avatar photo for my actual photo.

But that looks weird. Because of some weird effect around the photo.

To the chrome console we go => (right click then inspect element).

It looks like the problem is in `ch-info-front` or `ch-img-1` or maybe `ch-info-wrap`.

My actual process was to go to the code and comment it out and see what it effects...

With vim this is pretty straight forward. I type `/ch-info` (cmd - f in most text editors) to search.
And then I scan through and comment out sections of code. I use a vim plugin to comment and uncomment quickly => [vim commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
My actual workflow is => `shift v` to highlight the top line of the code and then `shift ]` to move to the next whitespace
(I hit that movement twice if selecting two paragraphs of text).
And then `gc` => which is the plugin command for commenting/uncommenting.

Its a little messy. But eventually I found the offending code.

Comment out lines 190 - 205 (two sections in a row that both start with `.ch-info-wrap`)


OK. Everything is looking pretty good now.

It's time to actually post our first blog post.

Remember, the way that Jekyll works is anything in the *Posts* directory with the correct time stamp is considered a post.

The format it needs is

=> `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

So for this post.

I'm going to save it as 2016-06-16-meta-blog.md

I move it into the posts directory and BOOM I can now see it on my front page! Woot woot.

(WIP blog-jekyll-3)


Unfortunately... this is what the actual post looks like

(WIP blog-jekyll-4)

Remember what we read earlier... we need to throw in a piece of meta data at the top so that Jekyll knows which format
we want to use.

I didn't give it much thought... I just jumped over to my file structure (I use the NerdTree plugin).

And I have my tree mapped to `leader tt` (and my leader is comma). And then I went to posts and pulled up one of the ones in there.

NICE. Looks like I need to put this at the top =>

<h2>
Markdown woes
</h2>

I've been trying to type markdown as I go... but I am definitely not a markdown pro...

So at this stage I started going through the post again and fixing all of my formatting.
I had been using a form of pseudo code as I was writing where I would just type `(WIP blah blah)` like for images as an example.
But now its time to make things look good. I used this => [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists)

NOTE: If you are using Vim and apostrophes are giving you problems snag the tpope/vim-markdown plugin.
