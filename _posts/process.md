I've been stuck on a problem for a few days in a row. And that oftentimes means one of a few different hthings.

1) I don't know how to do the thing I'm trying to do.
2) I'm working on the wrong theing and don't realize it (probably what is happening here).

The issue I'm currently working on solving is the making it so that when i reload my front end UI
it won't reload the actual page that I'm on.

In order to do this though I know that I need to be sending JSON response objects. And that is
where my problem comes in. Because I decided that Ithat I needed to refactormy initial design before I could eep going witht eh thing I was
trying to solve.

This magnified the problem as I now feel liiemaybe that was wrong (sinece the code I was writingdid not expressly dictate that I needed to write the coe I am writing.

Being reflective... this is definitely a trend in my life. Too much mind... too little action.

And something very much worth learning.

The world in general foavors those with a s trong disposition towards action.

Does this mean that thinking through the steps is a bad idea?

Obviously not. Sharpen the axe is still very relevant.

The point is that if you are better about choosing small workable steps. Then it will become much easier.


Therefore I believe that I need to be working on a few habits:

1) I need to be taking more atomic steps. One little thing, followed by a different thing. And work through a series of small things.

This should come with time but building the discipline is something worth doing.

2) I need to always test first.

Every time you don't write a test first before writing production code is building the anti habit.
Especially since you are in an apprenticeship right now... you really need to work on that.

3) I still have some deficiencies in my workflow and tools.

VIM, github, etc.

I believe that these will really take off once I start pairing with other crafters. I'm a very visual learner so I'm not super worried.
It's definitely on my radar though.


Delay the time to write your first line of code...

Play => This is a Josh Cheekism. And something he's said to me many times.

Just try to do some katas in that language or framework. Mess around in the repl. It will get easier and easier as I learn more things.

ok so this is the dream.

Writing about process so that I can figure out how to make it better int he future.

Good idea jerome.

The very first thing to realize about process is that you can always be getting better at it. No matter what you can make it better.

A different hting to think about abs well is that when you work on process it should translate to better everything.

For the most part I fogllow this exact process.

I decide I wantt to do something... or it gets assigned, etc.

If I think I know something about the thing... I'll generally just dive in.

Until I get stuck.

Otherwise I will go through and read documentation (something I'm definitely getting better at btw).

Recently I have laso been spiking out my assignements and doing them without tests before starting with tests.

I generally find this this to be a useful method. Where it falls down though is I still don't know how to test.

Oh... i understand what testing is and how to do it. and I can figure it out for most any language at this point.

But WHAT to test... that is something different all together... and espcisllally when trying ti imagine good design.

I spend too much time thinking about good design. What is it and how to do it.

I think I would be better off if I wrote smaller easier tests and then went from there.

Wrtie a small easy test. do it.

Write 10 more and then refactor.

My process isn't that well defined yet though.

Probably the biggest thing is not knowing what/how to test.
